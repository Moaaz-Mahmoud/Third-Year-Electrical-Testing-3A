Classification of Device Technologies
	• Discrete logic
	• Programmable devices (FPGAs)
	• ASIC (Application specific IC)
System Representation
	• Behavioral level
	• Structural level
	• Physical level
System Abstraction Levels
	• Transistor level
	• Gate level
	• Register transfer level (RTL)
	• Processor Level
FPGA Definition
	An array of gates in addition to some other elements such as memory 
	controllers and communication interfaces that can be programmed and
	reconfigured more than once.
FPGA Applications
	Cryptography, ASIC prototyping, Industrial, medical and Scientific 
	Instruments, Audio/Video and Image processing and broadcasting, 
	high-performance computing, AI, and Deep Learning, Military and 
	Space applications, Networking, packet processing, and other 
	communications
FPGA Design Flow
	• Architecture design	  : involves the analysis of the project requirements, problem decomposition
	• HDL design entry	  : using HDLs to describe the design
	• Test environment design : writing test environments and behavioral models to ensure the correctness of the HDL description
	• Behavioral simulation	  : comparing the HDL outputs and the behavioral model to ensure the correctness of the HDL description
	• Synthesis		  : involves the conversion of an HDL description to a netlist
	• Implementation	  : a synthesizer-generated netlist is mapped onto particular device's internal structure
	• Timing analysis	  : to ensure the implemented design satisfies the timing constraints

Unfamiliar Verilog Operators
	• Exponentiation: **
	• Concatenation: {}{}	{2'b01}{2'b10} yields 4'b0110
	• Replication: {{}}	{3{2'b01}} yields 6'b010101
Coding Styles
	• Structural modeling: gate level → `and(x, a, b);`
	• Dataflow modeling: C-style assignments → `assign z = x && !y;`
	• Behavioral modeling: initial and always blocks → 
	  ```
	  always @ (x or y)
	    begin
	      z=0;
	      if (x ==y)
	      z=1;
	    end
	  ```
